# pi-nav-ui

The user interface for [pi-nav](https://github.com/cogwirrel/pi-nav)

This is a mostly-intact fork of [ffwdme.js](https://ffwdmejs.org/), a very awesome open source in-browser sat-nav!

It's modified to replace the browser's geolocation implemenation with one that calls the pi-nav server.

## Setup

See the readme in [pi-nav](https://github.com/cogwirrel/pi-nav) for everything you need to know.
