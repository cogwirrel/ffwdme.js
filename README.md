## User interface for pi-nav

This is a hacked fork of [ffwdme.js](https://ffwdmejs.org/) for use as the user interface to [pi-nav (Raspberry Pi navigation)](https://github.com/cogwirrel/pi-nav)

It's modified to replace the browser's geolocation implemenation with one that calls the pi-nav server.

### Setup

See the readme in [pi-nav](https://github.com/cogwirrel/pi-nav) for everything you need to know.
